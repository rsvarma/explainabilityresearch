Hector Bellerin is fast becoming seen by fans, and possibly even by his manager, as Arsenal's premier right back, after impressing in the absence of Mathieu Debuchy. The young Spaniard scored his second Premier League goal, cutting inside and curling left-footed past Simon Mignolet, in the 4-1 win over Liverpool last weekend, and is developing a reputation as a player capable of becoming a top-level full back. But, it seems, in the dressing room, it is his status as the club's premier sprinter, rather than as a defender, that is most in question, after he beat Theo Walcott's 40 metre club sprint record last summer. Hector Bellerin scored a brilliant goal to put Arsenal ahead against Liverpool last weekend at the Emirates. Bellerin has emerged as a star player after filling in for the injured Mathieu Debuchy at right back this season. 'We were just having a test and then they told me I was the fastest at the club,' Bellerin told The Telegraph. 'I did not beat it by that much. There was a bit of banter and he is trying to beat me now.' Bellerin shaved a hundredth of a second off Walcott's time, prompting the 26-year-old winger to vow to reclaim his title at the end of the season. . And since then he has gone on to establish himself as a right-back of some promise, progressing well beyond Arsene Wenger's expectations.  . 'I am happy that now, after not so good performances in the beginning, the coach has still put confidence in me and given me minutes. . Bellerin has exceptional pace, as he proved in August when he set a new Arsenal record over 40 metres. Theo Walcott had previously held the record, but Bellerin shaved one hundredth of a second off his time. But Walcott is determined to take his record back from Bellerin this summer and be speed king again. 'The chances always come through injuries, which is not a nice thing. Now we are going to have Debuchy back and I am happy for him, but when you get your chance, you need to do the best you can. I have done my best to take this opportunity.' With Debuchy on the verge of match fitness, Bellerin will soon find out whether he has done enough to grab that opportunity. . But after his brilliant goal at the Emirates stadium last weekend, one thing is for certain - he is no longer known just for being quick over 40 metres.  .


Hector Bellerin scored his second Premier League goal against Liverpool last weekend. The Spaniard has impressed in the absence of Mathieu Debuchy this season. But it is his speed over 40 metres that has made him a [91mstar[0m at the club. The 23-year-old beat Theo Walcot's club sprint record last summer.

Former QPR manager Harry Redknapp feels he still has plenty to offer football but only at the right club, having turned down a 'mind-blowing' offer to coach abroad. The 68-year-old handed in his resignation at Loftus Road in February, citing knee problems behind the decision to leave the Barclays Premier League strugglers, although he later claimed 'people with their own agendas' had a hand in his departure and described the situation at the west London club as 'a bit of a soap opera'. Redknapp will return to the dugout on Sunday, May 31 when he leads a star-studded Men United XI against Leyton Orient Legends, as O's youth coach and Prostate Cancer UK ambassador Errol McKellar hosts a charity football match at The Matchroom Stadium. Harry Redknapp (right) says he would consider a return to management as long as it's at the right club. Redknapp was speaking at the announcement of a Men United XI vs Leyton Orient Legends charity match. The well-travelled former West Ham, Bournemouth, Portsmouth, Southampton and Tottenham manager, Redknapp feels 'fit as a fiddle' again following knee surgery and would relish another crack at a full-time job, but only under certain circumstances. 'It is difficult to know whether you want to go back in again, but if the right offer came along for the right job then I would consider it, because I do love the game and certainly do miss it,' Redknapp said. 'But unless it was the right job I would not bother. It has got to be something which I really wanted to do. 'It would not be a case of the money. I had an offer earlier this week to go and work abroad where the money was incredible, a mind-blowing offer, but at the moment it did not interest me. 'I have my wife here, my grandkids and everything else, so it has got to be something I wanted to do. Redknapp resigned as Queens Park Rangers manager with immediate effect in February. Redknapp left the Loftus Road outfit citing knee problems behind his decision two months ago. The 68-year-old left Queens Park Rangers with the club 19th in the Premier League table at the time. 'I don't have to work any more if I don't want to at my age, but I feel fit as a fiddle and if I could go into a club somewhere, maybe try to get them up from the Championship or somewhere in the Premier League, then I might be interested. 'I could even work with a younger coach to help them and they could then take over as manager in a year or two, to help build the club up; that is something which would interest me but we will have to wait and see what comes along.' While it remains to be seen what chapter will be next in Redknapp's colourful management career, he hopes to see one of his former clubs Bournemouth go on to secure promotion to the top flight for the first time, with the Cherries currently top of the Sky Bet Championship heading into the final three matches. He said: 'The job which Eddie (Howe) has done is second to none. He has been amazing, taking things on to another level. . Redknapp is full of praise for the job current Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe has done at the club. The Cherries sit top of the Championship with three games of the season remaining. 'I can't see them not going up because they are the best team in the league, playing the best football in the division and are a pleasure to watch. They never change their philosophy home or away and are brilliant to watch. 'The owner has come in, Max (Demin) the Russian, and has put his money in, helped take the club on. So you don't know (what they could do after promotion) but I would just like to see them get there.' Redknapp lost close friend and former West Ham team-mate John Bond to prostate cancer and is backing the Men United campaign to help raise awareness of the disease, which is the most common cancer in men with more than 10,000 deaths each year. He said: 'Prostate Cancer is something which can affect any family at any time so it is important that people come out to support this cause. 'We are all scared that if the doctor tells you that you have something wrong, but if you get there early enough it can be cured - you can't let it just go.' Redknapp  lost close friend and former West Ham team-mate John Bond to prostate cancer. People are being urged to search Men United and do something great with their mates via prostatecanceruk.org/menunited. Tickets for the Men United XI match are priced at Â£10 adults and Â£5 concessions, and are available from www.lofcdirect.co.uk.

Tim Sherwood's jacket did not survive beyond the first 10 minutes and after this astonishing contest it remains to be seen if either of these sides fare much better. When Aston Villa's animated manager threw his gilet to the ground in celebration at the sight of Christian Benteke's first half equaliser, he probably rather hoped his players were man enough to remain in the Barclays Premier League after all. Indeed when he then saw Benteke convert the second of his three goals after 33 minutes, he may have felt his damning critique on Monday had provoked exactly the response he was looking for. But the grit, desire and determination his forwards had demonstrated was lacking at the opposite end of the field and a QPR side every bit as desperate to maintain their top flight status did a fine job of exposing exactly the weaknesses Sherwood had highlighted. Matt Phillips (left) headed Queens Park Rangers into a seventh-minute lead, getting on the end of Bobby Zamora's cross. Winger Phillips garnered just enough power on his head to plant beyond Brad Guzan in the Aston Villa goal . Joey Barton wheels away after watching Phillips nod in at the back post, as Ciaran Clark (left) and Carlos Sanchez appeal for offside . But QPR were only ahead for three minutes after Christian Benteke equalised for the hosts at Villa Park . Benteke drove beyond Rob Green from the edge of the box to net his seventh Premier League goal of the season. If it made for a hugely entertaining encounter, it must have been hell for the managers however friendly they might claim to be. Sherwood walked off the pitch at half-time with his hands planted casually in his pockets, comforted by the fact that his side were sitting five points clear of relegation danger. But when Charlie Austin followed Chint Hill's second half equaliser with a third goal for the visitors, Villa had replaced Chris Ramsey's spirited side in the bottom three. Only 12 minutes remained, and even if Benteke required just five more minutes to score again with a terrific free-kick the overriding feeling in the Villa ranks was certainly more one of frustration than relief. Benteke did not look like a man who wanted to enjoy his hat-trick at the sound of the final whistle. On the contrary, he looked devastated. Both sides have some difficult games ahead but when Tottenham and Manchester City come next for Villa, there is plenty to concern Sherwood. A replay of QPR's goals will not make pleasant viewing. The failure to close down Bobby Zamora before he delivered the cross that enabled Matt Phillips to strike after only seven minutes. The failure to challenge Hill and so stop him scoring his first Premier League goal. The failure too to respond to the threat being posed by Austin, who was allowed to take a touch to control the cross from Phillips before driving the ball past Brad Guzan. Such frailties could yet drag Villa down this season, and Sherwood knows it. 'We are not equipped unfortunately to go anywhere and dig out a result,' he complained afterwards, and on this evidence he would appear to be right. .  . Aston Villa (4-4-2): Guzan 6; Bacuna 6, Vlaar 5.5, Clark 6, Richardson 6; Cleverley 6.5, Sanchez 6.5, Delph 7, Grealish 6.5; Agbonlahor 7.5, Benteke 8. Manager: Tim Sherwood 7.

CLICK HERE to view our brilliant Match Zone - including Christian Benteke's second goal. Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood threw down his gilet in celebration after Benteke scored the early equaliser. Benteke was at the double in the opening 45, sweeping beyond Green to put Villa ahead just after the half hour. Defender Clint Hill was the unexpected scorer of QPR's equaliser just after half-time to make it 2-2. Hill grabs the Queens Park Rangers badge in celebration after scoring his first ever Premier League goal. Charlie Austin got ahead of Ron Vlaar and had looked as if he'd won the game for QPR. At times his side were excellent here, thrilling their supporters with a tremendous first half display. Phillips might have landed the first blow for QPR but the players he was probably referring to as 'the icing on the cake' were giving him plenty of cause for celebration. They were attacking with great flair and finesse, with the pace of individuals like Gabriel Agbonlahor and Leandro Bacuna and the sheer power of Benteke. The call for more men made Sherwood's selection of 19-year-old Jack Grealish somewhat curious. But the teenager too was performing well. More than man enough for the occasion. As a game it was something of an emotional rollercoaster, even if the warmth of the embrace between Sherwood and Ramsey before kick-off was soon replaced by the cold reality of a dire situation for both teams. Never one to hide his feelings, Sherwood responded to QPR's opening seventh minute goal by unzipping the aforementioned gilet in disgust. It was understandable really, given how meekly his defenders tried to stop Zamora from delivering the cross Phillips then headed home from close range. Only three minutes later and the same gilet was off altogether, Sherwood throwing it to the ground after seeing Benteke's shot take a nasty deflection off Mauricio Isla's trailing foot and loop over Rob Green. . The drama in the technical area added to the sense of excitement around Villa Park. The atmosphere was electric, the place almost erupting again when Grealish so nearly marked his first Premier League start with a goal. Benteke delivered a perfect ball into the path of the teenage winger only for Green to make the save at his feet. Sherwood's decision to play a midfield diamond and exploit the pace of his attackers was working well for Villa. Not everyone seemed to agree, and at one stage Sherwood seemed to be placating a fan who didn't seem quite so impressed. But his team were playing with real verve, with Benteke scoring a second after 33 minutes with a goal that owed as much to the speed, vision and courage of Agbonlahor as the precision of the finish. Agbonlahor was just quick enough to send Benteke clear before being hacked down by Sandro, and remained curled up in a ball while his colleague raced towards goal. Benteke finished cleverly, shaping to shoot beyond Hill before dragging his effort back inside the QPR defender and beyond the reach of a wrong-footed Green. . Austin salutes the travelling Rangers supporters inside Villa Park but they weren't able to cling on to the points . But Benteke's wonder free-kick, much like Jason Puncheon's on Monday night, meant Villa came away with a point. Benteke can't conceal his delight at completing his hat-trick and rescuing a point in the 83rd minute. Good friends Chris Ramsey (left) and Sherwood know each other well and were going head-to-head in the dugout for the first time. Former Villa striker Stan Collymore couldn't hit his elation in the press box after Benteke knocked in his second of the goal. Sherwood urges the supporters packed inside Villa Park to up the ante as they looked to move clear of trouble . Charlie Austin vies for possession with Kieran Richardson during an intense and entertaining first half. Niko Kranjcar attempts to get QPR back in the game but couldn't steer his effort beyond the American Guzan. Villa Park looked a picture on Tuesday night as the two relegation battlers went head-to-head in Birmingham . Sherwood said Ramsey was one of the finest coaches he had worked with and he certainly impressed here. He had seen how his forwards had been starved of service in the first half and responded after six minutes of the second by making two substitutions. It had the desired effect, Hill equalising four minutes later; punishment for what appeared to be Bacuna's failure to stay with his man. Austin's goal â his 17th in the Premier League this season - would be a further source of concern, even if Benteke did then level for a second time with a wonderful free-kick that beat Green via the inside of a post. Are they man enough? Only time will tell.

Derby County season ticket holders from the 2010-11 campaign might struggle to believe it but Alberto Bueno prepares to face his former club Real Madrid on Wednesday as the highest-scoring Spanish-national in La Liga with a big money move to Porto waiting for him at the end of the season. Bueno played for Derby on loan five years ago, but with just five goals in 29 games he looked anything like Champions League material. After returning to Valladolid he moved to Rayo Vallecano and at the club with one of the lowest budgets in Spanish football he has had the season of his life. Now Champions League quarter-finalists Porto, coached by Spaniard Julen Lopetegui, are ready to poach him. Alberto Bueno (left) in action for Derby against Norwich during his unsuccessful spell with the club. Bueno celebrates scoring for Real Madrid against Real Union in November 2008. Bueno has scored 17 goals for Rayo Vallecano this season and could soon move to Porto. AGE: 27. CLUBS (League record only) Real Madrid (2006-09): 97 apps, 22 goals. Real Madrid (2008-09): 3 apps, 0 goals. Valladolid (2009-13): 85 apps, 13 goals. Derby (loan, 2010-11): 29 apps, 5 goals. Rayo Vallecano (2013-) 65 apps, 26 goals . Seventeen of the 35 goals that Rayo have scored this season have come from Bueno. He hit four in one game earlier this year against Levante and will be gunning for his old club on Wednesday night. Bueno came through at Real Madrid in the 2006-07 season when then manager Fabio Capello fast-tracked him from the C-team to train with David Beckham, Luis Figo and Raul. He eventually made his full debut in both La Liga and the Champions League two seasons later but like so many strikers from Real Madridâs youth system before him he was going to have to leave to really launch his career. Following in the footsteps of Alvaro Negredo and Roberto Soldado he left the club in 2009 signing for Valladolid from where he spent a season at Derby before ending up back in Spain. Negredo and Soldado both made it into the Spain squad after they succeeded away from Madrid and national team boss Vicente Del Bosque will be watching on Wednesday when Bueno goes up against Sergio Ramos as Rayo Vallecano look to take the scalp of Real Madrid in their rickety atmosphere-charged three-sided Vallecas stadium.  .


Alberto Bueno has scored 17 goals for Rayo Vallecano this season. The 27-year-old is the highest-scoring Spanish-national in La Liga. Bueno played for Derby on loan in 2010-11 but scored just five goals. He has been linked with a move to Porto in the [91mChampions[0m [91mLeague[0m.

At the grand old age of 75, Jack Nicklaus is still capable of hitting aces. The Golden Bear added another magic moment to his storied career at Augusta National in the Par-3 Contest. Stepping up to the tee on the 130-yard fourth, the greatest golfer of all time saw his shot sail beyond the flag before spinning back into the hole. Jack Nicklaus gave the crowd something to cheer with a hole in one on the fourth during the Par-3 Contest. Nicklaus holds up his ball to an adoring crowd as Gary Player (left) and Ben Crenshaw salute the great. Crenshaw and Nicklaus fist pump following his ace on the 130-yard hole at Augusta National. Nicklaus was playing alongside Gary Player and Ben Crenshaw  as the first roar of Masters week filled the skies in a sunswept Georgia. 'I had an interview this morning, and I said "well, all I've got to do is go out and win the Par-3 and make a hole and one", and I make a hole in one,' Nicklaus said afterwards. . The ace was Nicklaus' first on the hallowed turf of Augusta, but the veteran saw his achievement eclipsed by that of Camilo Villegas on a day which saw five hole-in-ones, levelling the record from 2002. The Colombian followed Nicklaus with an ace on the fourth and also managed one on the eighth, but he couldn't quite land the title, losing out to world No 74 Kevin Streelman in a play-off. Nicklaus became the youngest person to wear a green jacket in 1963, and collected his sixth in 1986. He is one of five men to complete the career grand slam, an accolade which favourite Rory McIlroy can achieve if he wins his third major in succession.

Tony Pulis returned to Selhurst Park for the first time since he left Crystal Palace and masterminded a victory which pulled his West Bromwich Albion side to the edge of safety. Alan Pardew tried new ideas on the pitch to outwit Pulis but an early goal from James Morrison and stunner from Craig Gardner meant he could not deliver a satisfying result against the man who left Palace two days before this season kicked off. Despite the timing of his departure, however, there was very little bad blood between Palaceâs fans and Pulis who was roundly applauded as he came out from the tunnel in the corner of a ground where the seats are close to the pitch and the crowd can be unforgiving. A few boos broke the surface, but they were drowned out by waves of the respect he deserved for saving them from relegation last season, during his 10-month tenure, when he won the Premier League LMA Manager of the Year award. West Brom midfielder Craig Gardner celebrates having scored the second for Tony Pulis' side with a fine long ranged effort . Before two minutes on the clock, James Morrison (right) headed West Brom ahead following a corner from team-mate Chris Brunt. The West Brom players race to congratulate Morrison (top left), who headed the away side in front against Crystal Palace on Saturday.  . Crystal Palace (4-3-3): Speroni 6; Ward 6, Delaney 6, Dann 6, Ledley 6 (Souare 46 6); McArthur 6 (Sanogo 80), Jedinak 6 (Gayle 46 6), Puncheon 6.5; Zaha 6.5, Murray 6.5, Bolasie 8.

It has got unbelievable potential and I mean that. The supporters are wonderful and they have a good manager. They can push on â if Alan is given the money and the opportunity to push this club forward this club could be a good club.â Yannick Bolasie even made the effort to go over and shake Pulisâ hand as he strolled down the touchline. Yet the south London locals would not have been expecting what came within two minutes of kick off when West Brom took the lead. Chris Bunt swung in a corner from the left and James Morrison managed to lose Palace midfielder Jason Puncheon and nod in, completely free, from five yards out. Some of Puncheonâs team-mates looked around in disbelief that the West Brom man was afforded so much space in the box. âThat was a weakness in our set up that Tony exploited,â Pardew admitted. âIt was well worked. Their guy took Puncheon to the edge of the box where he is not comfortable marking. âWe knew Tony would know the players well, know the strengths and weaknesses, I tried to throw a few ideas in on the pitch. They didnât come off. . Crystal Palace winger Yannick Bolasie greets former Eagles boss Tony Pulis (right) before kick-off at Selhurst Park on Saturday afternoon.

People know Tony does an honest job, he plays the game his way and we respect that.â Despite that early set back, however, Crystal Palace started to play the eye-catching football that has made Pardew so popular in these parts during his short spell in charge. And it was all coming through their main man, Bolasie, on the left. In the 24th minute he weaved into the box, played a one-two then poked an effort towards the near post which West Brom goalkeeper Boaz Myhill did well to save with his feet. Three minutes later he cut in from his flank and bent an effort towards the far corner that Myhill clawed out. Then, just after the half-hour, a ball came in from the opposite flank from Joel Ward, was headed on by Glenn Murray and Bolasie executed a sublime bicycle kick, only to be denied by Myhill once again. . If Pulis, dressed in his usual full tracksuit, trainers and cap on the touchline, provided this Crystal Palace team with the spine and solidity to compete in the top flight, Pardew, resplendent in suit and tie, has given them the suave and flair to delight. In this instance, Pulisâ resilient style prevailed and against the run of play they added a second on 53 minutes. The ball came out from a West Brom corner and Gardner took a touch before, 30 yards out and slightly to the right of goal, he buried a right-foot strike over Julian Speroni into the left of goal. It is almost mission accomplished for Pulis at West Brom as they moved to 36 points and put a healthy gap between themselves and the bottom three. .

Adam Federici lay inert on the turf for a moment. He realised the magnitude of what happened. He understood the horror of it instantly. He let his head rest on the grass and closed his eyes as if he was trying to wish it all away, as if he was trying to blot out the din and the agony and the wild celebrations of the Arsenal fans. His face was scrunched against the grass, distorted in a mask of despair. Reading, still struggling to avoid relegation to League One, had performed heroically to push Arsenal into extra-time in this FA Cup semi-final and Federici had pulled off a series of stunning saves to keep the sides level at 1-1 but the Australian goalkeeper guessed there would be no way back now. There had been less than a minute to go before the extra-time interval when Alexis Sanchez had cut in from the left and fired in a stinging shot straight at Federici. He knelt to gather it but somehow it squirmed through his legs and trickled over the line as he scrambled in vain to retrieve it. It was football at its most cruel. In years to come, it will be the enduring image of this game. Alexis Sanchez's low shot squirmed agonisingly through the legs of Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici in extra time. It was a routine shot from Sanchez but the Reading stopper failed to collect it properly in his grasp - an embarrassing gaffe. The ball rolled through his legs and slowly towards the goal line in the 106th minute of the game. Federici tries desperately to stop the ball going over the line after it rolled through his legs and out of his grasp. Reading had fought valiantly but were unable to score another equaliser to take the tie to penalties. Federici lies slumped on the ground as the impact of his error hits him in the FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal. The Reading goalkeeper, who had been magnificent until then, left the field in tears as manager Steve Clarke tries to console him. Federici's opposite number, Wojciech Szczesny (left) of Arsenal comforts his fellow goalkeeper after the game is resolved. Reading: Federici, Gunter, Hector, Pearce, Obita, McCleary, Williams, Chalobah (Cox, 106), Robson-Kanu (Karacan, 90), Mackie, Pogrebnyak (Yakubu, 111). .

Subs not used: Wilshere, Ospina,  Monreal, Flamini. Goals: Sanchez 39, 106. When the final whistle confirmed that it would be Arsenal who will face either Liverpool or Aston Villa here at the end of next month, Federici, 30, put his head down and began to walk purposefully from the pitch, his thoughts fixed on some form of escape, some search for sanctuary. The Reading manager, Steve Clarke, tried to console him but he was inconsolable. As he disappeared down the tunnel, he hung his head and wept. Sure, the bigger picture was that Arsenal now have a chance to become the most successful club in the history of this competition by winning it for the second year in succession. The bigger picture is that this time, their success in the FA Cup seems less like a consolation prize and more like a gateway to a new period of glories at a club that had been starved of them until last seasonâs Cup final victory over Hull. But above all, this was the kind of human drama that peoples this competition and adds to its legend. âI am happy we are through,â said Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny. âBut I thought Federici was terrific today. He had the game of his life and they only got to extra-time because of him. He was the best player on the pitch. I really feel for him â I have been there, done that.â. Clarke did his best to ease Federiciâs pain, too. âThis is the life of a goalkeeper,â said the Reading boss. âAnd Adam is a top goalkeeper. Thereâs every chance heâll be Readingâs player of the season this year. His performances in the Championship have been crucial. âWe stick by him. I understand his worth and the supporters understand how important he is. Adam is a strong character as well. Heâll take his disappointment on the chin and on Wednesday night when we play Birmingham Iâm sure heâll be as good as he always is.â. Clarke also complained that refereeing decisions had counted against his team. He had some justification but nothing can dull the memory of how his side pushed Arsenal all the way. There were times when it seemed Arsene Wengerâs team, who had been pegged back by the Championship strugglers in normal time, might be overwhelmed by the sheer relentless refusal of their opponents to accept defeat and by a team spirit that would not fade. The match became a test of Arsenalâs fortitude as well as their class. In former years, they might have buckled. . Sanchez leaps skywards to celebrate his second goal of the game for Arsenal against Reading. Sanchez (left) rifles Arsenal into the lead against Reading in the FA Cup semi-final against Reading. Arsenal had an inconsistent first half before Sanchez struck clinically after Mesut Ozil passed to him excellently. Sanchez (third right) turns away in celebration as Reading's players lay crumpled on the ground after conceding . Striker Sanchez (right)  celebrates alongside team-mate Keiran Gibbs after scoring for Arsenal against Reading. Gareth McCleary's second-half strike went over the line for Reading after a deflection from Keiran Gibbs . McCleary runs over to the Reading supporters at Wembley to celebrate scoring the equaliser for the Championship side. Reading's players celebrate the goal with McCleary as they pulled themselves level with Arsenal at Wembley in the semi-final. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger (centre) gives instructions out to his team before the beginning of extra time. Federiciâs mistake gave them an escape route that they followed eagerly. They had nearly taken an early lead when Per Mertesacker rose to meet a corner at the near post and Federici had to dive smartly to his left to push it off the line. Later, he produced a stunning one-handed stop to keep out a header from Gabriel. Reading held firm but Arsenal started to exert more and more pressure. Mesut Ozil, in particular, was a delight to watch in possession. There are increasing signs that the German is finally beginning to find his best form and he beguiled Reading with a series of sweet turns and beautifully measured passes. Seven minutes before the interval, Arsenal broke the stalemate. It was Ozil, inevitably, who was the inspiration. He collected the ball midway inside the Reading half, took time to pick his pass and flighted a curling ball to Sanchez in the box. Sanchez did the rest, although the rest was not simple. He controlled the ball on his chest with his back to goal, turned and committed Garath McCleary by shaping to shoot. Then, with time, the Chilean forward prodded the ball past Federici and wheeled away to celebrate. . Gabriel (right), a replacement for Per Mertesacker, powers a header at goal shortly after Reading had scored. But Reading goalkeeper Federici made a splendid one-handed save to tip the ball up and against the crossbar. Sanchez (centre) earlier took the ball past goalkeeper  Federici (second left) before losing his footing and falling. Daniel Williams (left) shoots at goal for Reading against Arsenal at Wembley but his attempt went wide of the goal. It seemed then that Arsenal would extend their lead. Readingâs threat had been negligible. But they came out for the second half with new belief and to the delight of their fans massed behind the goal, they forced an equalizer. Pavel Pogrebnyak must take a lot of the credit for squeezing in a cross when it looked as though he had run out of space near the byline. The ball drifted over Kieran Gibbsâ head and as Szczesny scrambled across his line, McCleary volleyed the ball back across him. Szczesny got his hands to it but he had not been able to prevent it crossing the line. Suddenly, Reading wanted more. Jamie Mackie clipped a lovely chip into the path of Danny Williams on the edge of the box. It fell to him nicely but Williams sliced his volley wildly wide. The game was harum-scarum now. Reading sensed an upset. Mackie urged the fans on and they roared back. But six minutes from the end of normal time, Reading escaped when Aaron Ramsey missed an open goal, crashing a left-foot shot against the post. Ramsey held his head in his hands. Redemption was not far away for him. It will take longer to greet Federici. Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck (centre) has an effort blocked by Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici.

Bayern Munich will be without midfielders Bastian Schweinsteiger and Franck Ribery when they travel to Porto for Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final first leg. Frenchman Ribery is not yet fully fit following a five-week absence with an ankle injury while Schweinsteiger has had a virus for the past few days. 'Bastian and Franck will not be with us against Porto. That is bitter,' sports director Matthias Sammer said on Monday as the problems started to pile up for the treble-chasing Bavarians. Bayern boss Pep Guardiola has a long injury list to contend with as he aims for domestic and European glory. Bastian Schweinsteiger lies injured on the pitch during Bayern's 1-0 win against Borussia Dortmund on April 4. Medhi Benatia, David Alaba, Javi Martinez and Arjen Robben had already been sidelined by injuries. Jerome Boateng, who was rested for Saturday's 3-0 win over Eintracht Frankfurt due to a minor muscle problem, is back in the squad. 'Those who are with us have our full trust,' Sammer told reporters ahead of the team's departure for Portugal later on Monday. 'The team is hungry.' Bayern are 10 points clear at the top of the Bundesliga and are also through to the German Cup semi-finals.

The mighty boot of Marcelo Bosch kept the English flag flying in Europe as the Argentinian kicked Saracens through to the Champions Cup semi-finals with a famous last-minute penalty. No chorus of boos or whistles would stop the sweet strike rising above the 1950s tower blocks in the Colombes suburbs, with the ice cool 31-year-old mobbed by players and coaches as Racing Metro 92 were unceremoniously dumped out of the competition. It was the South Americanâs finest moment since he arrived on continental shores. Referee Nigel Owens was escorted off the pitch by security but his call âpenalising replacement lock Fabrice Metz with 10 seconds left on the clock â was the correct decision and ensured a classic finale to match bereft or flair and finesse. . Scenes of elation as Saracens clinch victory with the last play of the match against Racing Metro 92. Marcelo Bosch kicks the match-winning penalty from long-range to snatch Saracen's a semi-final berth. Argentine Bosch raises his arms aloft after being entrusted with the final kick of the game . Bosch jumps into the arms of Rhys Gills after his successful kick as Hodgson joins the celebrations. Bosch is mobbed by his elated Sarries team-mates after his kick sails over the posts for the win.

Tries: Nil Penalties: Hodgson (2), Goode, Bosch Conversions: Nil . âThe last time I kicked to win the game was when I was 21 and playing for an amateur club in Argentina,â said Bosch. 'It was from more or less the same range and it was against our clasico rivals. It was a great memory for me, but it was a long time ago. âI tried to be as relaxed as possible. We had the wind in our face and I didnât want to force it. I tried not to think about what it represented and I said, âWhy not? I can take it.â The rest is history. With kicks like this, youâre either the hero or the bad guy - Iâm happy that it went my way.â. It was the sort of strike that was associated with Ronan OâGara during his illustrious playing career with Munster and Ireland. The retired No 10, now kicking coach for the Top 14 side, watched helplessly from the stands of the Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir as the ball sailed between the posts to set up a knockout meeting with Clermont in Saint Etienne. .

They would drink champagne at half time but this was an abrasive and at times unabsorbing encounter, offering little to inspire the Parisian painters couched on the sidelines to capture the moments of magic. The partisan home crowd were angered by two of Owensâ decisions in the opening quarter, with the Welshman not penalising Alex Goode for a block on French winger Teddy Thomas and scratching off a potential try for Dimitri Szarzewski because of a knock on. Charlie Hodgson kicked two first-half penalties â either side of a 27th minute try for Maxime Machenaud after Saracens lost an attacking scrum - Jim Hamilton was shown a yellow card, the tourists were fortunate to go into the break with a one-point advantage. âWe weren't great in the first half, even though we had a very strong wind,â said Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall. âWe were unable to build any pressure. Playing into that very strong wind and with Jonny Sexton playing No 10 for the opposition, being 6-5 up at half time felt like a mountain to climb.  . Marcelo Bosch is an Argentine utility back who moved to Europe in 2006 to play for Biarritz. He joined Saracens in the 2013-14 season and has featured predominantly at centre. He is not Saracensâ first-choice kicker - Owen Farrell, Charlie Hodgson and Alex Goode are all above him - but he has a hugely powerful strike. Itâs earned him cult status with the Allianz Park crowd, who chant âBosch, Bosch, Boschâ whenever he lines up one of his kicks. As a teenager, Bosch played football in Buenos Aires but claims that it was always his dream to play rugby in England. He married Augustina last summer and they are expecting twins. . Bosch's football skills aid his powerful kicking. Racing Metro 92 winger Teddy Thomas shows his speed to avoid Chris Wyles and escape the in-goal area. Sarries' stand-in captain Hodgson places his grubber kick underneath Wenceslas Lauret. Racing Metro and Ireland fly-half Jonny Sexton (left) locks horns with Sarries winger David Strettle. Strettle is upended going for a high ball against Racing's Brice Dulin, who escapes a yellow card . âBut that's where it turned around and I'd say our second half performance was as courageous, brave and hard working as I've seen. We went hunting and kept knocking them down, scrapping for absolutely everything. Our rugby could have been better and it wasn't a beauty of a match, but we put them under enough pressure to make some errors and give us a chance.â. Cigarette smoke filled the air and, having never previously progressed from the pool stages, the hosts looked like they were choking on the pressure. Racing did most of the running but Saracens edged further ahead, with Goode also adding his weight to the kicking with a 47th minute penalty. Wales and Racing centre Jamie Roberts threatened in attack, but was hauled off in the 52nd minute. Bosch then tackled his countryman Juan Imhoff just short of the line â although the pitch-length move was subsequently pulled back for a forward pass â and Billy Vunipola intervened with a crucial turnover to snuff out a Racing attack. But Saracens were unable to build upon their lead and, just past the hour mark, Racing narrowed the gap thanks to three points from Machenaud. A game of kick tennis ensued and the French No 9 pushed his side into the lead with his second penalty 10 minutes later. The blue and white flags were waving and the bass drum was beating but, sacrebleu, Metro tried to run down the clock. Then Metz came flying off his feet at the crucial moment. Bosch stepped up for the penalty and, after a short run up, his kick floated gracefully between the sticks. . England No 8 Billy Vunipola fends off Racing centre Henri Chavancy   at Yves Du Manoir Stadium in Colombes. Sexton fires a bullet-like pass as he clears the ball from the ruck against Saracens. Sarries winger Chris Ashton gets a kick away under the tackle of Argentinean Juan Imhoff.

Bayern Munich cruised to a 6-1 victory against Champion's League rivals Porto last night. . But not all eyes were on the pitch for the whole 90 minutes, as the German club's manager Pep Guardiola broke the highly dramatic atmosphere with a moment of sartorial comedy. To put it bluntly, he split his pants. A flash of upper thigh and navy boxers made themselves known as he strode up and down the touchline shouting commands at his players. . SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sartorial slip-up: Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola runs through tactics with his players, while ignoring the draft that has emerged at the top of his left leg . A hint of navy: Guardiola's tight-fitting trousers before the tear (left) and after the rip (right) during Bayern Munich's 6-1 victory over Porto. The Spanish tactician, who teamed his tight, grey suit with a navy pullover, black tie and crisp white shirt, joked after the clash: 'I'll have to buy new ones for the next match.' . Guardiola wouldn't be the only famous face guilty of stepping into a suit that is a little on the snug side. The current trend for wearing a whistle and flute that is at least a size too small, presumably to showcase a well-honed physique, has seen plenty of stars sail a little close to the wardrobe malfunction wind. So, who's guilty of worshipping at the altar of super-tight slacks? . Russell Brand. Guilty. Dermot O'Leary. Guilty. Olly Murs. In danger of restricting the blood flow. . Yes, it's officially a wardrobe malfunction...but has Guardiola simply fallen foul of wearing a suit that is a little on the snug side? Blame 007: Daniel Craig wore a close-fitting Tom Ford suit in 2012 Bond movie Skyfall...and thousands of men followed the trend. And breathe! If Beckham gets the snug look just right, his fellow Essex boys, including Jeff Brazier (pictured right) are guilty of going a little too tight. The rock star's take on the whistle and flute: Harry Styles doesn't bother with a jacket but his trousers are certainly skinny, while Russell Brand goes for a second (snake)skin with his casual version of the suit. King of the second skin! Dermot O'Leary rarely wears a suit that could be described as roomy. The trend for a tighter fit has emerged in recent years with 'skinny', 'slim' and 'heritage' fits all offering a snugger-looking silhouette. Cast an eye back three years and the most recent incarnation of James Bond, in Sam Mendes' 2012 movie Skyfall, was seen wearing the kind of form-fitting suit that makes you wonder how it might have been possible to wear it AND brawl on top of a train while hurtling through Turkey. . Throughout the film, an unruffled Daniel Craig sported a grey, tailored suit by Tom Ford which may have been the catalyst for other celebrities wearing a similar look. During his just-ended eight-year reign on The X Factor, Dermot O'Leary's suits have got progressively smaller, seeing him once forced to reach for a safety pin moments before presenting the live show. O'Leary said at the time: 'I remember having a wardrobe malfunction on The X Factor. . 'I had this tight-fitting Alexander McQueen suit and felt the trousers ripâ¦from pole to pole, shall we say. I just had to skilfully apply a safety pin and hope for the best. It was terrifying.' . High street menswear retailer Hawes & Curtis told FEMAIL that figure-hugging clothes are no longer just for women. Not much room to give! Olly Murs, who split his trousers on stage in Sheffield in 2012, sails close to the wind again here while performing at the V Festival in 2013. A thigh-ful! Towie stars Dan Osborne and Joey Essex are both partial to leaving little to the imagination when it comes to formal wear . Edward Smith, head of brand for the company said: 'The skinny look has taken over everyone's wardrobe, regardless of gender. 'Men have been wearing tight T-shirts and shirts for a while now - our best-selling shirt is now an extra slim one.  . 'Remember, men don't want to look great at the weekend and then put on a baggy old suit for the working week. The office is just as much their chance to shine, so suits have had to go through a skinny transformation as much as any other garment.' . Other stars who've fallen foul of their own outfits exposing them include fellow X Factor presenter Olly Murs, whose penchant for clothes that show off his best assets saw his trousers split as he performed on stage at Sheffield Arena in 2012. . Wearing a matching burgundy waistcoat and pants, the star was dancing on his knees when the fabric covering his undercarriage gave way revealing sparkling white pants. For more examples, you only have to wander to the streets of Chelsea or Essex, as the reality television stars who grace our screens on The Only Way is Essex and Made in Chelsea don't appear to own a more roomy suit between them. . Towie star Dan Osborne is clearly proud of his buff body and regularly showcases it in slimline attire and Joey Essex is also partial to a tight pair of strides. While David Beckham rarely gets it wrong these days when it comes to fashion, he is definitely also a fan of a tight suit, and arguably carries it off to perfection. . What do the fashionistas make of the super-snug suit? Fashion blogger Simon Glazin isn't convinced by the current trend. He told FEMAIL: 'Over the last couple of years, terms like 'super skinny' and 'ultra skinny' have been adopted by menswear retailers when it comes to suiting, and to be quite honest, they scare me.' 'There's the circulation-restricting connotations the words 'ultra skinny' bring with them but also the simple truth that a too-tight suit can be quite hideous to look at.' Men are in danger of going for a debonair look but can end up revealing way too much, he adds. . 'You don't want to show the world everything you've got! . 'Some things should remain, erm, under wraps. You find bigger men stuffing themselves into these skinny suits, and the results are disastrous. 'As male models get thinner, so do suit cuts, but this is NOT representative of this country. Us men with 'real' bodies need suits that don't feel restricting. And don't restrict blood flow.' Who should you go for if you want comfort and style? 'Designer labels such as Versace and Salvatore Ferragamo offer suits that have a bit of breathing room.' Let's hope Pep, Dermot and Olly are reading.  .

It was another momentous night in Barcelona's proud European history, Neymar and Luis Suarez rampaging through Paris Saint-Germain's defence to put one foot in the Champions League semi-finals. And Barcelona's second of the night, in the 67th minute when Suarez stormed through, nutmegged David Luiz and finished, was their 400th goal in the competition. The landmark has been achieved in 202 matches since 1992 when the European Champions Clubs' Cup became the modern Champions League we know and love. The two goals scored by Luis Suarez against PSG took Barcelona past 400 Champions League goals. Barcelona have reached the landmark in 202 Champions League matches since 1992. Barcelona won the quarter-final, first-leg match 3-1 to put themselves in control of the tie. Barcelona still have a little way to go before they catch Real Madrid's 436 Champions League goals. Table courtesy of Opta. However, Barcelona still have a some way to go to match the 436 goals scored in the competition by their great rivals Real Madrid. The Spanish giants are way out on top in the club scoring charts, with Bayern Munich coming in third with 349 goals and Manchester United fourth with 343. Over the Champions League years, Barcelona have found the net most against AC Milan (22), followed by Celtic and Chelsea on 18 apiece. They have scored 17 times against United, Arsenal and Bayer Leverkusen. And it will come as little surprise that Argentine superstar Lionel Messi is way out in front in the breakdown of Barcelona Champions League scorers with 75, the joint-most in the tournament with Cristiano Ronaldo. Brazilian star Rivaldo comes in second with 22 goals, followed by Patrick Kluivert (20), Luis Enrique (19) and Samuel Eto'o (16). To mark Barcelona passing 400 Champions League goals, we take a look at some of the highlights. Barcelona 4 Manchester United 0 (1994-95 group stage) A United side hampered by a limit on foreign players had the misfortune to encounter Johan Cruyff's Barcelona 'Dream Team' at the wrong time. . Hristo Stoichkov and Romario ran United's makeshift defence ragged in front of 114,000 fans, with the Bulgarian scoring twice and the Brazilian once before Albert Ferrer completed United's humiliation. Romario fires home Barcelona's second goal in their 1994 rout of Manchester United in the Nou Camp. Barcelona 5 Chelsea 1 (1999-2000 quarter-final, second leg) Leading 3-1 from the first leg at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea fancied their chances of getting through ahead of the return. . Rivaldo's deflected free-kick and Luis Figo's goal had erased the deficit by half-time, though Tore Andre Flo put Chelsea back in the box seat. . They were seven minutes from going through when Dani Garcia made it 3-1 and there was still time for Rivaldo to miss a penalty. Chelsea's defence crumbled in extra-time, another penalty, this time converted by Rivaldo, and a fifth from Patrick Kluivert carried Barcelona through. . Luis Figo curls the ball home during Barcelona's 5-1 win over Chelsea in 2000. Barcelona 2 Arsenal 1 (2006 final in Paris) The Champions League triumph that signalled the beginning of Barcelona's golden age. . They needed two goals in the last 14 minutes to overcome the stubborn resistance of Arsenal, who had been reduced to 10 men when Jens Lehmann brought down Samuel Eto'o just 18 minutes in. . The Gunners sensationally took the lead through Sol Campbell's thumping header eight minutes before half-time but couldn't hold out as Eto'o and Juliano Belletti sunk them late on. . Captain Carles Puyol lifts the trophy with Ronaldinho after Barcelona's 2006 win over Arsenal. Barcelona 4 Bayern Munich 0 (2008-09 quarter-final, first leg) Pep Guardiola's star-studded team showed their Champions League-winning potential with this demolition of Bayern in which all four goals came before half-time. In no mood to hang around, Lionel Messi opened the scoring after nine minutes and Eto'o added another three minutes later. A second from Messi and another from Thierry Henry essentially settled the two-legged contest before half-time. Thierry Henry salutes Samuel Eto'o after rounding off Barcelona's 4-0 rout of Bayern Munich in 2009. Barcelona 2 Manchester United 0 (2009 final in Rome) Sir Alex Ferguson's team were going for their second Champions League triumph in a row and had beaten Barcelona in the 2008 semi-finals. . Guardiola's team had other ideas and exacted revenge thanks to a 10th-minute opener from Eto'o and Messi's clincher 20 minutes from time. It was Barcelona's midfield partnership of Xavi and Andres Iniesta that ran the game. . Lionel Messi (left) and Andres Iniesta parade the European Cup after the 2009 win over Manchester United. Barcelona 4 Arsenal 1 (2009-10 quarter-final, second leg) One of Messi's finest performances as the maestro scored four times to demolish Arsenal's Champions League hopes. . With the last-eight tie locked at 2-2 from the first leg, the Nou Camp was stunned when Nicklas Bendtner scored a precious away goal on 18 minutes. From then on, it was a one-man show. . Messi had equalised within three minutes and had Barcelona in control with another couple before the break, including a sumptuous lob. A fourth late on made it an emphatic win. Messi scored four times as Barcelona demolished Arsenal in a 2010 quarter-final . Real Madrid 0 Barcelona 2 (2010-11 Semi-final, first leg) This Clasico semi-final in 2011 was a dream come true for all football fans and it was Messi and Barcelona that kept their cool as tempers frayed. . Real hothead Pepe was sent off in the 61st minute and boss Jose Mourinho sent to the Bernabeu stands shortly afterwards for protesting. Cue Messi to seize control, turning home Ibrahim Afellay's cross and then setting off on a 30-yard run to score the second. . Barcelona pile on Messi after his goal in the Bernabeu semi-final back in 2011. Barcelona 3 Manchester United 1 (2011 final at Wembley) Barcelona were unquestionably the best team in Europe at this time and another final triumph over United confirmed this. At Wembley, Pedro gave them the lead in the 27th minute, only for Wayne Rooney to level shortly afterwards. But Barca were by far the better team, dominating possession, and it came as little surprise when Messi fired home at the start of the second half. David Villa made sure 20 minutes from time as Barca claimed a third European Cup in five years. . Pep Guardiola is thrown into the air by Barcelona after their 2011 final win over Manchester United. Barcelona 7 Bayer Leverkusen 1 (2011-12 last 16, second leg) Messi raised his game to even greater heights, becoming the first player to score five goals in a Champions League fixture in this seven-goal drubbing of Bayer Leverkusen. . Leading 3-1 from the first leg in Germany, there was little pressure on Barca and their domination was exemplified by their 865 passes in the game to the German side's 217. . Many of them found their way to Messi, who scored twice before half-time and added another three after. Messi slots home his fourth goal in Barcelona's 7-1 demolition of Bayer Leverkusen in 2012. Manchester City 0 Barcelona 2 (2013-14 last 16, first leg) City desperately wanted to make a statement on the European stage but Barcelona had other ideas in this clinical away performance. . The decisive moment came in the 54th minute when Messi was fouled by Martin Demichelis, who was sent off.

Here FEMAIL has rounded up the 20 unusual things you can do with coffee filter papers   . 1. As a makeshift lid . Worry not if your only microwave-friendly bowl has lost its lid. Simply turn a filter paper upside down and place it over the dish when you pop it into the microwave. 2. To strain juices. Use them as filters when you are straining freshly squeezed citrus fruit juices such as lemon or lime juice. Or a bottle of wine which has bits of cork in it. . 3. As cupcake holders. Forgotten to buy baking tin liners for when youâre making cupcakes? Line your cupcake tin with filter paper and start to pour your cake batter in. .

Use them as disposable snack bowls for nuts, popcorn, and mini pretzels when youâre throwing a party where you donât want to put out plates. 5. To prevent rust . Place a filter on top of a cast iron pan so that it soaks up all residue moisture, preventing any rust from occurring. . 6. Vegetable crisper. Keep celery crispy by storing them with a coffee filter, which are far more absorbent than kitchen roll, and will absorb moisture from the vegetables. 7. Butter cake tins . The next time youâre oiling a baking pan or cake tin, spread your butter or oil with a coffee filter instead of using a brush or a paper towel. 8. Stop messy ice-cream spillage. Wrap a filter around the centre of an ice-cream cone to keep little hands clean from ice-cream mess. 9. To hold your bouquet garni. Use it as a bouquet garni holder the next time youâre making soup or stews. Simply pop in the herbs you want into the bottom of the filter and tie with twine or string before popping it into your pot. Wrap a piece of coffee filter paper around your sticks of celery to keep them from going soggy and limp. A few drops of essential oils onto a couple of filter papers when drying will keep them smelling fresh. 10. Quick and easy tea strainer . Looking to brew a cuppa with fresh leaves but misplaced your strainer? Measure a teaspoon of leaves, and as with the bouquet garni, place leaves at the bottom before tieing the top ends of with string.

Simply dip them in your nail varnish remover and start gently scrubbing. . 13. Absorb nasty smells . Make your own odour-eaters by placing a heaped teaspoon of baking powder at the bottom of each filter, then gathering it up the top ends together and tying it up with string. Place in stinky shoes. 14. Keep your face oil-free. They make inexpensive and absorbent face blotters.  . Place tea leaves and herbs in the middle of your filter cone and tie it up with string before brewing . Add a dab of shoe polish to a paper filter and use it to shine your shoes . 15. Keep delicate crockery safe. Moving house and in possession of delicate crockery which absolutely cannot break? Simply place coffee filters between your china when packing to protect them. 16. Keep clothes smelling fresh . Put a few drops of your favourite essential oil onto a couple of filter papers before chucking them in the tumble drier when youâre drying your clothes for an inexpensive way to scent them. 17. Pot plants without soil spillage. When repotting a plant from the nursery, pop a coffee filter at the bottom of the new pot so that soil doesnât leak out on the floor. This is especially useful for house plants. 18. Composting . Place a filter at the bottom of your kitchen compost pot so that there are no leakages or spills. Simply empty the whole lot out the next time you are adding to your compost pile. 19. Polish your shoes. Coffee filters are perfect for polishing leather shoes as they are lint-free and so wonât leave unsightly streak marks on your shoes. Apply a dab of your favourite shoe polish on the filter and use it as an applicator. 20. Clean mirrors and glass . As they are lint-free coffee filters can be used to polish glass, and clean mirrors. .  .

A 17-year-old boy who was shot dead from behind by a police officer had just stolen a handgun, according to the police department in question. Justus Howell was gunned down from behind by an officer in Zion, Illinois on Saturday afternoon after officers were called to reports of an argument. The chief of the Zion Police Department has now said that the argument was in fact a scuffle over a handgun - during which the firearm went off and Howell allegedly pointed it at another teenager. Killed: Justus Howell, 17, was shot twice in the back by police in Zion, Illinois, on Saturday afternoon. 'Stole a handgun': Police say that Howell had just taken a weapon from Tramond Peet, 18, who was trying to sell it to him. Steve Dumyahn said Howell was struggling over a gun with Tramond Peet, 18, and started running when police showed up. Peet told officers he met Howell with the intention of selling him the gun - but Howell tried to snatch it without paying. He then claimed the two tussled over the weapon, which was fired into the ground. At one point, he said, Howell was pointing it at him. Peet told investigators that he let go of the gun when he heard sirens. He said Howell ran and that he heard officers shouting instructions, then opening fire. An autopsy on Howell revealed that he was hit by two bullets, both from behind. Aftermath: Investigators are pictured above at the scene of the shooting, which took place around 2pm . One his his left side and penetrated his heart, spleen and liver. The second hit him on the right side of his back. Tests to see whether there were drugs in Howell's body are not finished yet. In the wake of his death, Howell's mother LaToya told Fox News her son 'couldn't have been a threat'. She said: 'Justus was a young man murdered by Zion police'. . 'As he was fleeing from police, they killed my son. He couldn't have been a threat if he was running.' Peet appeared in court Monday on two counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon. He is being held on a $15,000 bond. . Dumyahn said the Zion Police Department was releasing the narrative from the shooting because media outlets had linked Peet's case to the shooting. He said the department has 'no desire to defame the deceased'. Courts: Peet appeared in court Monday charged with two counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon. Claim: Zion Police chief Steve Dumyahn said the department had 'no desire to defame' Howell, but released the details because media outlets realized his case and Peet's are connected. Dumyahn said the officer who shot Howell is a nine-year veteran, and is now on administrative leave. . He did not release the officer's name or any additional information about him, including his race. Lake County NAACP president Jennifer Witherspoon said his relatives have asked her organization to speak on their behalf. Witherspoon said authorities told the NAACP that they have videotape of the scuffle between Peet and Howell but can't yet say what led the officer to shoot Howell. She said Howell's relatives are hoping to find out exactly what happened as quickly as possible. She said: 'Whether it was a mistake on his part or a mistake on the police's part, they want answers to make sure something like this never happens again'. Howell's death is the latest in a series of unarmed black men being killed by police officers - the most high-profile example of which was the death of Michael Brown at the hands of Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri. .

I pop in there a lot. 'I don't think it's true. I don't understand why - other people make louder noises. Other people do the same. 'Everyone has their own way. People above and below us are noisy too. I sometimes stamp my feet to get them to quieter down. 'I wouldn't mind if the people next door were doing the same!' When Daily Mail Online knocked on the apartment door a dog barked loudly and after a pause a woman said: 'Hello?' Asked for comment she said: 'I'm unavailable at the moment'. Neighbour Siddharth Shah, 29, a Long Island University student, said that sometimes the lovers fight and make a racket - but mostly they make love. He said: 'It happens three or four times a week though I'm at school in the day so it could be more. 'They usually go at it for 10 to 15 minutes and I hear them all over the apartment. 'Sometimes it's the bedroom and sometimes it's in the lobby by the front door.' Another neighbor said: 'It's really loud. 'I have to put on music because you can hear everything.' The building owner Madelene Behefte, 73, said she had no idea about the complaints. She said: 'People should call the landlord before calling the city to complain'.
